I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## My Work

  *  the HTML file is following the logical structure 
     *  head
     *  body
        *  header
        *  main
           *  section
              *  div
        *  footer
  *  Change the title to Marketing Agency
  *  GitHub repository name: 
  *  The URL to the website is: Code-Refactor-March-24
  *  The git hub URL is: https://saghar-b.github.io/Code-Refactor-March-24/
  *  The URL of the GitHub repository : https://github.com/saghar-b/Code-Refactor-March-24
  
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 
WHEN I view the source code 
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
